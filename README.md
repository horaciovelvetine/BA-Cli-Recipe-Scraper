## Usage

HOWTO: 
    "bin/console" runs the application. Before running "bundle" will be required to pick up the neccasary gems for your quest. 

    Instructions should be pretty easy to follow. If not, theres even an about/tutorial screen built in. You can find a few verified working links below, but all of them were just grabbed off of twitter directly, they tweet about 5 a day, and a not small number of them end up containing repeats of recipes.

## Potential Things to Work On (V1.0.0): 
    1. Case Menu system: a few of these are a little clunky still, could use a proper walkthrough. 
    2. Single Recipe Scraping: actually already built in, just needs to be added as an option. 
    3. Author scraping is a little wonky - currently defaults to Bon-Apetit for all articles
    4. Can the menu (case) system be made into an object? 
    5. Refactor link input menu to print X number (or all) of the previous listicles instead of the last 15
    6. General Reformatting to make CLI reading less brutal. 
    7. build a redundency checker into scraper so not storing duplicates of recipes.
