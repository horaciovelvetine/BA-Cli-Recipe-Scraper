## Information:: 

    This repository is currently undergoing a transition from my first app, to being a reference repository to becoming a plugin for my portfolio website//final. The original version was a very simple application built to scrape Bon Apetit Listicles so you could make a shiopping list. This is intended to be a smaller component of a larger bookmarking system Im currently working on building for myself as a webapp. This will still be used in no small part to pull articles, just not neccasarily only from Bon Ap. 


## Usage::

    LOCAL USAGE INSTRUCTIONS: 
        This repository includess, in the original spirit of the original build I did for FIS Mod1, a comman line tool which can be used standalone. In order to get that application first fork and clone this repository locally to your macine using your preferred mechanics.

            Then: 
            1) In the parent directory first run: 
            ```bundle install```
            2) Next ruby bin/console.... or some other nonsense (future james figure that structure out)

## Goals:: 
    
    SHOULD:
    1) Plugin to Bookmarkr portion of the website fairly easily and be able to be used to scrape a bookmark and pull out the HTML. 
    2) Should have a variety of plugins which use that HTML and known variable declerations on pages to pull out addressable // needed elements of that page for use in further use.
