## Information:: 

This repository is currently undergoing a transition from my first app, to being a reference repository to becoming a plugin for my portfolio website//final. The original version was a very simple application built to scrape Bon Apetit Listicles so you could make a shiopping list. This is intended to be a smaller component of a larger bookmarking system Im currently working on building for myself as a webapp. This will still be used in no small part to pull articles, just not neccasarily only from Bon Ap. 


## Usage::

LOCAL USAGE INSTRUCTIONS: 
    This repository includess, in the original spirit of the original build I did for FIS Mod1, a comman line tool which can be used standalone. In order to get that application first fork and clone this repository locally to your macine using your preferred mechanics.

Then: 
1) In the parent directory first run: 
```bundle install```
2) Next ruby bin/console.... or some other nonsense (future james figure that structure out)

## Goals:: 

SHOULD:
1) Plugin to Bookmarkr portion of the website fairly easily and be able to be used to scrape a bookmark and pull out the HTML. 
2) Should have a variety of plugins which use that HTML and known variable declerations on pages to pull out addressable // needed elements of that page for use in further use.
3) Should begin including testing framework with the intended future goal of making this a "gem" Imported into the main repository, for now will simply be a means of developing quickly locally and testing. 

## Learning Goals:: 

1) Learn about release cycle of tech
2) Learn about gems & understand that system of importing/exporting (which I now understand is NPM on the JS side) 
3) Learn about writing and creating unit tests for code using a testing library


## To Do's :: 
1) Get comfy again 
2) Pick testing framework & Learn said framework
3) Begin seperating out and objecting/abstracing/refactoring
4) Establish goals for functionalities 
5) establish convention for including site specific variables which care adjusted
