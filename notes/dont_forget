##Additional Notes / Reminders
 1. Listicles have many recipes have many ingredients. ---- But Listicles dont need to reference ingredients.... UNLESS to add the Shopping cart feature. Listicle.Ingredients may be the "BTS" call that makes the shopping cart function happen. 

 2. Shopping carts have many ingredients 

 3. Ingredients will be collected in a hash, that hash is Key = Quantity and Value = Ingredient_ name 

 4. Recipe.steps should return an array by of indexed steps, steps should correlate with index #. 

 5. Build route backwards from link input menu up to the top menu 

 6. the CLI class should be responsible for displaying everything - not "listicle" not "recipe" 

 7. add an exit program method inside cli??? How to do this. system(clear) clears terminal so maybe system(end)???
